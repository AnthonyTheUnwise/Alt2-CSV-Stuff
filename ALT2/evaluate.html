		In my opinion, our hypothesis was proven as Ireland appeared to do quite well on the graph!
		<br> I would say the thing that worked best for us was our level of teamwork, and the thing that held us back the most was the 
		python code not wanting to work for us.
		<br> I would say that our project would gain the most in the future from making sure the cleaning of our data is more thorough and 
		leaves no room for error, as it wouldve saved us a multitude of problems. </p>
