        <h3>Our Process</h3>
		<p class="center">
		When we started this, we had a rough idea on what we wanted our topic to be, but not on what to do within our topic. <br> 
		After a while, we decided on comparing datasheets about the Covid-19 Pandemic<br> What we wanted to see in particular
		 was the comparison of cases to deaths around the world, and whether Ireland in particular was able to handle it well.
